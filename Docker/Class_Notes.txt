	Containerization Using Docker !
	
	- Containerization :
		- It is a process of packaging the applications along with its dependencies.
		
		
		Docker Container!
		
	Deployments ::

		
			Dev 	--> Developers!		mywebappl
			
				Create the src code!
				
				
			Build 
				Compile & Create Artifacts --> mywebappl_svc1.war
				
				Unit Level Testing 
				
				Tomcat Web Application Server - mywebappl_svc1.war
					
					jdk_v11, tomcat:8.5 ==> mywebappl_svc1.war
					
					
					Package mywebappl_svc1.war 
					
					--> Create Application Image (mywebappl_svc1.war,jdk11,tomcat8.5)  

						mywebappl_svc1_img
						
					--> Publish mywebappl_svc1_img to the Container Registry 
					
				Promote mywebappl_svc1.war to Test Environment
				
			Test 
			
				QA  ========== mywebappl_svc1.war
				
					Pull that mywebappl_svc1_img from Container Registry 
					
					And Execute it as a Container.
				
				UAT ========== mywebappl_svc1.war
				
			Prod 
			
				    ========== mywebappl_svc1.war
		
	What is Virtual Machine ??
	
	- VMs are Hardware Level Virutualization
	- VMs are Created using Hypervisor 
	- VMs are used to run the Operating System by default 
	- VMs Consume more space and time to start up
	- VMs will continue to run even if there is no active task or application

	What is Container ?
	
	- Containers are OS Level Virutualization
	- Containers are Created using Container Engine 
	- Containers are used to run the Applications/Tasks. Not Operating System
	- Containers will immediately go to EXIT State if there is NO Active task or application
	- Containers Consume Less space and time to start up
	- Containers uses the Core of Operating System
		This is provide an isolated environment to the containers 
		- Kernel 
			- NameSpace  
			- Control Group(CGroup)			
	- Containers are used to reduce the number of VMs. 
			

	Terminologies ::
		
		Container Engine 	
			- To Manage the Container Images and Containers 

		Container Images 
			- Is a Static File, that defines the properties of Container
			- It is non-executable 
			- It composed of Various Layers
			- These Layers are created by using the Dockerfile Instructions
			
		Containers 
			- Containers are the executable units of Container Image 
			
		
		Container Registry
			- Used to Store and Manage the Container Images
				dockerhub
				ACR
				ECR 
			
		Container Repositories
			- Sub-Set of Container Registry
			
	Working with Docker Containers ::
	
	Install Docker Engine :
	
		https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
		
			sudo apt install docker.io
	
	Docker Cli Commands
	
	
	docker images		# List Images 
	
	docker ps 			# List Active Containers
	
	docker ps -a 		# List All Containers
	
	docker pull 		# Download Container Image from Container Registry to Local Machine
	
	docker run 			# Create and Run the Container
	
	Docker Run Mode :::
	
		- Foreground/Attached Mode 			# Default 
		
			docker run centos 
			
			docker run centos sleep 20
			
		
		- Background/Detached Mode 
		
			docker run -d centos 
			
		- Interactive Mode 
		
			docker run -it centos bash
