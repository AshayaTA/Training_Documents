	Kubernetes :::
	
		- Kubernetes is Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool 
		- Used to create replicas of containers 
		- Used for any type of Container
		- It can perform Auto-scaling / load-balancing!	
		- Self-Healing
		- Effecive External Volume Allocations 
		- Perform Deployments/Upgrade/Downgrade the Application Services without any Downtime!
			- Can easily achieve Continuous Deployment
			
		Micro-Service Based Applications :::
		
	
	Kubernetes Architecture
	
	Kubernetes Components
	
	Kubernetes Concepts
	
		- Kubernetes Cluster
		- Pods 
		- Controller Objects
			- Replication Controller 
			- Replicaset 
			- Daemenset
			- Deployment
		- Services 
			- NodePort Service 
			- ClusterIP

	Kubernetes Concepts/Terminologies :::
	
		kubectl 				# Command Line Utility to interact with Kubernetes Master 
		
		Kubernetes_Cluser		# Collection of WorkerNodes

	Working with Kubernetes ::::
	
	
	Install and Configure Kubernetes Cluster 
	
		Kubernetes_Master (Control-Plane)
			Kubernetes_WorkerNode1
			Kubernetes_WorkerNode2	
			
			
	kubeadm - Is command Line Utility used to config and setup the Kubernetes Master & Attache WorkNodes 
	
	
		1. Launch 3 VMs 
		2. Enable the required ports - using security group 
		3. setup host name 
		4. Packages/Commands to be executed on all Master & Worker Nodes
			- install docker 
			- cri 
			- kubeadm
			- kubelet
			- kubectl 
			- enable kubelet 
			
		5. Packages/Commands to be executed only on Master/control plane
			- kubeadm init 
			- setup access to kubectl 
			- Install Network Plugins used by Kube-proxy to enable pod networking 
			- verify the nodes/pods ....
			
		6. Commands to be executed only on WorkerNodes
			- kubeadm join 
			
		Kubernetes Dashboard

	How to Expose pods ?
	
		Services 
		
			- NodePort Service 
				- Is used to expose the pods to internet 
				- Node Port Range : 30000 to 32767 
				
				
	- Controller Objects
		- Replication Controller 
		- Replicaset 
		- Daemenset
		- Deployment

			Replicas of Pod 
			
			Launch a website :
			
				1000 Users can access at the same time 
				
				100 Instance of Pods 
				
				
				5000
				
				Scale-Up 
				
				Scale-Down 
				

		- Daemenset

				
		- Deployment :::

			Is used to Deploy the containerised workloads in kubernetes
			It can perform, New deployments,
			Existing Application Upgrade / Downgrade 
			Rollback 
			Scale-up/Scale-down
			
			It Create Deploy Object 
			It will automatically creates the Replicaset 
			Based on Replicaset, Pod replicas will be created
			
			All these things can be achieved without any downtime. 
			

			- Uses the RollingUpdate Deployment Strategy :	
			
			
			Deployed Pods :
			
			3 Instances of Pods ::
			
				pod1	--> v1.0 
				pod2 	--> v1.0
				pod3	--> v1.0
				
			Upgrade the app to v2.0 ::
			
				pod1	--> v1.0 	==> 	v2.0	

	- Services 
		- NodePort Service
		
		- ClusterIP 
		- Load Balancer 
		
			Routing Rules ::  IGRESS Rules 		-==> It is actually used to reduce the load balancer service 
			
				- Simple Routing 
				
				- Path Based Routing 
				
				- Host Based Routing

	- Volumes ::::
		
		--> Volumes are used to maintain the state of application services 
		--> It is used to maintain the persisant data throughout the execution of Application Service and beyond the execution
		
		Pod --> 500GB of Volume ??
		
		Storage Servers 
		
		
		deployed a pod in workerNode1 -- hostpath volume will be created 
		
Next :::		
		ConfigMap Volume 
		Secret Volume 
		Namespaces 
		
		Integrate Kubernetes Pods Deployment with CICD Pipeline
